## Values

- In the world: freedom
- In people: virtue - do to others what you would have them do to you

## Personality

According to the [16 personality types](https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types) I am either ISTP (explorer) or INTP (logician)
- Honest: I don't like lying. It only complicates things. Almost always.
- Quite: I'm normally pretty quite but can be talktive sometimes.
- Focused: I can be hyper focused at times and may not notice notifications.
- I dislike conflict/competition and try to avoid unnecessary ones. I try to have fun while working.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

I prefer recieving feedbacks in private and sooner rather than later. Would appreciate it if the negative ones are structured as improvements. 

## Work Patterns

I usually start working around 9 am. I will be out to run few times a week in the late afternoon. I like to run before the sun sets so in winter this can be as early as 4 pm, in which case I will come back and continue working after dinner. In the summer, I'll probably be out to run around 6.

How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?
- There may be some nights when I have trouble sleeping. On days after such nights I may need to reset myself with a quick nap for increase productivity. I tried drinking multiple cups of strong coffee but it was ineffective even though I normally do not consume any coffee at all!

## Communication Preferences

Slack is probably the best. There's a chance that I will miss the notification if I am focused (especially on the other monitor).


## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

When you don't feel safe in a conversation, how does this manifest itself in your actions or affects?
- If I'm frustrated or worried, I might be frowning (but I also frown when I'm focused so this may be a confusing indicator). I might also get defensive.
What about when you're just not having an "on" or "good" day?
- I might become awkward and less talktive.

### How to help

- Unless I'm super disturbed if I focus on work I should return to normal. If I'm super disturbed I need to fix the problem bothering me first.

## Me Being Me

Any habits that of yours that can be easily misinterpreted? Here's a good place to point them out.

- Sometimes I will frown when thinking hard or focusing to read. This causes wrinkles between my eyes that sometimes people mistake for me being upset. 
- Sometimes I will try to avoid small talk. It's not that I am trying to avoid you. I am probably just low on energy (possibly from too much small talk already for the day).
- I am curious and detail oriented and may ask a lot of questions for complete understanding. I'm not trying to make your life hard.

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

- I don't like it when someone gives ambiguous/wrong information instead of admitting that they are not sure. This will confuse me very much as I will be trusting the information that I am being told.
- Having to jump between multiple tasks/tickets. This will make me less efficient as it can take long time for me to focus/context switch.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

What long term career goals do you have for yourself? What interests do you hope or plan for your
future self to obsess over.
- Continuous learning
- Meaningful contributions that improve people's lives

## Areas for Development

- Faster context switching
- 80/20. Sometimes doing 20% of the work will cover 80% of the cases and to cover rest of the 20% cases will require 80% of the work. I'd like to get better at recognizing such scenarios to be more efficient.

## Ask Me About

Let's get to know one another! Here's a great place to list things you've done / activities you love
/ conversations you're (almost) always excited to have!
- Travel
- Food
- Pingpong
- Snowboarding/Surfing/Skateboarding (I'm not good but find these challenging and fun)
